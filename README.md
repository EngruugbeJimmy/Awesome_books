# Awesome books: plain JavaScript with objects

## Overview

In this project, we built a basic website that allows users to add/remove books from a list. This was achieved by using JavaScript objects and arrays, while using javascript DOM and basic events to dynamically modify the page.

## Project Tasks List (Working-in-progress)

- [ ] Implement only a basic UI with plain HTML
- [ ] Create a collection that keeps a list of books (hint: you can use an array of objects for that).
- [ ] Create a function to add a new book to the collection, with title and author.
- [ ] Create a function to remove a book from the collection (hint: you can use the array filter() method).
- [ ] Display all books saved in the collection in the top part of the page.
- [ ] Make sure that when a user clicks the "Add" button:
  - [ ] A new book is added to the collection.
  - [ ] The new book is displayed in the page.
- [ ] Make sure that when a user clicks the "Remove" button:
  - [ ] The correct book is removed from the collection.
  - [ ] The correct book dissapears from the page.
- [ ] Make sure that data is preserved in the browser's memory by using localStorage.
- [ ] To debug your application, you can use console.log(). Remember to remove debugging code before pushing your code to the remote repository.
- [ ] Don't use any library or framework, use only plain JavaScript.
